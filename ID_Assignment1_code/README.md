This website is for a bike company called Pizz. This is a website revamp. Original website was lacking branding and the arrangement was haphazard. 

By revamping the store, I hope to give this company a better sense of branding through a refreshed colour pallette as well as making it easier to navigate. Original website did not display any of their products in a presentable fashion especially in the homescreen.

As a buyer, I would like to see what products are being showcased before I even read the catalog. This revamp puts more emphasis on the bikes being sold itself and the extra functionality this site has such as the query function makes it easier for buyers to get in touch with the store to explore business opportunities or get something custom fitted for them.

I aim to make the process more streamlined for the buyer by making it easy to navigate using a more user-friendly UI.

Original colour scheme, white and hot pink, was outdated and did not fit the modern aesthetic. It was also hard to make a website that looked pleasing with such bright colours. By dimming down the colour pallette, it not only creates a more minimalistic and modern feel, but makes it easier on eyes of the buyer while emphasising the "pink" branding.


Features:

(Image slideshow) showcasing new arrivals where the user can manually click through multiple colours of the featured models of bikes. This gives the user an idea of what products to expect as well as establishing the brand once the site just opens up.

(Trusted retailers page) is added to let buyers know if there is a shop selling Pizz products in their town/country. This makes it easier for them as they can visit the physical shops and handle the products in person before making an informed purchase. This also helps the buyer save money on potential shipping costs.

(Query request page) allows buyers to get in touch personally with sellers. This lets the buyers make bulk orders or ask to get something custom commissioned by the Pizz team. This can also be used to ask general questions such as of shipping is available to a certain country.
